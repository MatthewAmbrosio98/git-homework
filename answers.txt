1. git add moves any changes you’ve made in your working directory to the staging, while git commit actually saves or “commits” those changes to your repository’s history.
2. if you delete the .git folder, the files will remain but all version history will be lost and it will not be a Git repository.
3. if somebody has your key, they can impersonate you and gain access to all your systems and repositories.
